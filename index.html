      <div class="about-section-content">
        <div class="body-text">As I've always been driven by a strong curiosity
          about everything
          that's innovative and tech-related, I've started my journey in tech and development by studying Computer Engineering, 
          which nurtured my passion and later led me to enroll in the Apple Developer Academy.
          <br><br>At the Academy, I’ve further
          improved my development skills
          by
          using a newly learning-by-doing approach, enhanced my soft skills by working in multiple teams and 
          had the chance to work for delivering human-centered solutions by having a new perspective about what's behind a tech product and its goals.
          <br><br>In addition, I’m also a freelance software tester every now and again, where I've been able to
          explore mobile, web and desktop products to detect bugs and failures in the work-flow/user-flow, 
          which was extremely useful in the testing phase of app development and even way before in the process - while prototyping.
          <br><br>As an endless learner, I'm eager to further broaden my perspective and knowledge and ready for new challenges to keep growing.
